# Diabetes-Prediction-Data-Science-in-Health-Informatics-
Developed a diabetes prediction model using logistic regression on a 100,000-record dataset, achieving 97% accuracy in identifying diabetes risk factors. Utilized a dataset of 100,000 patient records and leveraged Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn to 
effectively preprocess data by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables like gender and smoking history.
